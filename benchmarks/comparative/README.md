Comparative Benchmarks
======================

In this folder we compare `mlx.data` with PyTorch DataLoaders and `tf.data`. We
try to keep the comparison as fair as possible but like any benchmark it can
never replace real-world performance measurements on your particular use-case.

The goal is to show that `mlx.data` is concise and fast.

Running the benchmarks
----------------------

Each folder has separate instructions on how to download the data and run the benchmark.
